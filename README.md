### Project Overview

The e-commerce project leverages Vue 3, Vite, Vue Router, Bootstrap, and Pinia to deliver a modern, responsive, and performant user experience. The goal was to create a flexible and scalable application with a clean and maintainable codebase.

### Thought Process

1. **Modern Framework Choice**:
   - **Vue 3**: Selected for its improved reactivity system and Composition API, simplifying state management and component logic.
   - **Vite**: Chosen for its fast development server and build times, offering an efficient development experience.

2. **State Management**:
   - **Pinia**: Opted for its modular and intuitive API, which integrates well with Vue 3’s Composition API, ensuring a scalable and maintainable state management solution.

3. **Routing**:
   - **Vue Router**: Utilized for its powerful routing capabilities, enabling dynamic route handling and seamless navigation.

4. **UI Design**:
   - **Bootstrap**: Integrated for its responsive grid system and pre-built components, speeding up development and ensuring a consistent design.
   - **Custom CSS**: Employed to address specific design needs and achieve a unique look and feel.

## Design Choices

### Component-Based Architecture
- **Utilized Vue's component-based architecture**: Created reusable and modular UI components to promote code reuse and maintainability.

### Responsive Design
- **Implemented Bootstrap’s grid system**: Ensured the application is mobile-friendly and adapts to various screen sizes.

### Performance Optimization
- **Adopted Vite**: Choose Vite for efficient build processes and a faster development server, leading to improved build times and reduced overhead.

### State Management
- **Adopted Pinia**: Used Pinia for its modern approach to state management, simplifying complex state logic and enhancing code organization.

### User Experience
- **Focused on delivering a smooth user experience**: Designed a clean and intuitive UI with responsive elements to enhance device usability.

### Router Transitions
- **Implemented Vue Router transitions**: Applied transition effects to improve navigation between different views, contributing to a smoother user experience.

### User Authentication
- **Integrated user authentication**: Ensured secure access to protected routes and actions, such as adding items to the cart, by verifying user credentials.

### !!!IMPORTANT NOTE!!!
Mock API Limitation: Currently, the mock API does not support filtering by price range. Consequently, filtering by price range only applies to the items on the current page. This approach was necessary due to API constraints.
