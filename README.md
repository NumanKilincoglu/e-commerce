### Project Overview

The e-commerce project leverages Vue 3, Vite, Vue Router, Bootstrap, and Pinia to deliver a modern, responsive, and performant user experience. The goal was to create a flexible and scalable application with a clean and maintainable codebase.

### Thought Process

1. **Modern Framework Choice**:
   - **Vue 3**: Selected for its improved reactivity system and Composition API, simplifying state management and component logic.
   - **Vite**: Chosen for its fast development server and build times, offering an efficient development experience.

2. **State Management**:
   - **Pinia**: Opted for its modular and intuitive API, which integrates well with Vue 3’s Composition API, ensuring a scalable and maintainable state management solution.

3. **Routing**:
   - **Vue Router**: Utilized for its powerful routing capabilities, enabling dynamic route handling and seamless navigation.

4. **UI Design**:
   - **Bootstrap**: Integrated for its responsive grid system and pre-built components, speeding up development and ensuring a consistent design.
   - **Custom CSS**: Employed to address specific design needs and achieve a unique look and feel.

### Design Choices

1. **Component-Based Architecture**:
   - Leveraged Vue's component-based architecture for reusable and modular UI components, promoting code reuse and maintainability.

2. **Responsive Design**:
   - Utilized Bootstrap’s grid system to ensure the application is mobile-friendly and adapts to different screen sizes.

3. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Choose Vite for efficient build processes and a faster development server to improve build times and reduce overhead.

4. **State Management**:
   - Adopted Pinia for its modern approach to state management, making complex state logic easier to handle and improving code organization.

5. **User Experience**:
   - Focused on delivering a smooth and intuitive user experience with a clean UI and responsive design for better device usability.

NOTES!!!
Mock API Limitation: Currently, the mock API does not support sorting or ordering by price. Consequently, filtering by price only applies to the items on the current page. This approach was necessary due to API constraints.
